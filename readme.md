# CurNotes - IntelliJ - Plugin

IntelliJ (and all intellj based IDEs) from 
jetbrains can use plugins to expand the range of functions.

This is a Plugin for all intellj-based IDEs.

## What can I do with this ?

With this plugin, you can save some notes to your project on an very easy way.

The notes will be stored in .idea folder - so normally they will not be 
tracked by a version system (like git), if you exclude your .idea -folder from git.

If you **want** to be your notes to be tracked by git, you can add this line into your .gitignore file:

!.idea/.curNotes.txt
